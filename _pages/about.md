Throughout my journey as a **seasoned entrepreneur**, I've founded [OmniEdge](https://omniedge.io) (established in 2021) in the United States and an **EdgeComputing IoT startup** in China (established in 2018). With a decade of **global experience** in the **robotics** and **automobile sectors**, I've honed my skills in **product development** and **interdisciplinary integration**. I've built an **international team** of experts from countries like Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Macao, Germany, the US, and China, successfully managing **remote, cross-functional teams** in my entrepreneurial endeavors.

My wide-ranging expertise in **robotics, AI**, and **IoT**,**SaaS** has paved the way for successful enterprise project implementations across numerous industries. Skilled in handling **cross-national distributed teams**, I've had the privilege of speaking at **Tsinghua University** in China on industrial robots and the industrial internet, as well as at **Bocconi University** in Italy on Peer-to-Peer VPN for enterprises.

In my previous capacity as an expert for the **National Industrial Robot Cloud Platform**, I contributed to multiple national-level industry white papers as an editorial board member. My product received a nomination for the esteemed **2019 Golden Pin Design Award**, and my company secured second place in the **Artificial Intelligence Town Incubation Camp**. Additionally, we participated in both the **NVIDIA Inception program** and **AWS Accelerator programs** in China and the United States.

Throughout my career, I've held positions like the **Asian Technology && Project Lead** in Germany, where I oversaw multinational automotive projects, and a **robotics application engineer**, developing state-of-the-art applications for the semiconductor and automobile industries. My professional experiences span various countries, including Asia, Europe, and the United States.
